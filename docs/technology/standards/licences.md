# Licences

## MIT

Use the [MIT licence](https://opensource.org/license/mit) for all new TNA projects.

You can use and include modules and resources which also use the MIT licence.

## Apache/BSD

You can use modules and resources which use either the Apache or BSD family of licences.

Use package managers wherever possible such as [NPM](../../third-party/npmjs.md) and [PyPI](../../third-party/pypi.md) to avoid bundling other code in your application.

If you include Apache or BSD-licenced work in your source code then you must also include:

- the original copyright notice
- a copy of the license itself
- if applicable, a statement of any significant changes made to the original code
- a copy of the `NOTICE` file with attribution notes (if the original library has one)
