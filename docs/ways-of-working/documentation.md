# Documentation

## Standards

Technical TNA standards are documented in this handbook and the [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/nationalarchives/engineering-handbook).

These standards SHOULD apply to all TNA projects.

### Requesting changes

Anyone in TNA is able to open an issue or pull request to this handbook.

Suggestions for new technologies or standards can be done with a RFC process.

1. [Open an issue using the proposal template](https://github.com/nationalarchives/engineering-handbook/issues/new?template=proposal.md&title=RFC%3A+New+proposal)
1. The TGB will review the proposal and ask questions in the open, taking unresolved queries to the TAG
1. A pull request can then be opened to change the standards

## Project documentation

1. **Location**
    1. All services MUST have a landing page in Confluence
    1. Project documentation MUST NOT be added to SharePoint
    1. Project documentation MUST NOT be added to Google Drive
    1. Project documentation SHOULD be open and accessible to the public if possible
1. **Diagrams**
    1. Mermaid diagrams SHOULD be used for simple diagrams such as sequence and C4 diagrams
    1. [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) SHOULD be used for more complex diagrams
    1. [draw.io](http://draw.io/) COULD be used for more complex diagrams if access to LucidChart is limited
1. **Applications**
    1. Each application MUST have a [`README.md`](version-control.md#readme) that briefly explains the application

Please talk to a memeber of the [TAG](../organisation/technical-architects-group.md) if you are unsure how to access or update the project documentation or diagrams.
